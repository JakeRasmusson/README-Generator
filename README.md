  # Readme Template Generator
  

## Description
  
My goal for this application was to create a professional Readme template generator.  This application will help me when creating readme.  Instead of looking for a template everytime I can just come here a generate one in a matter of a minute or so.  This will help speed up the work flow when creating readme's for projects in the future.

## Installation
  
To install this application start by downloading the files from the Github repository.  Next you are going to open the repository folder in Microsoft Visual Studio Code.  Once open right click anywhere in the folder and select open in integrated terminal.  This will open a terminal in Vscode.  Once the terminal is open type "npm i".  This will read the package JSON and install all required packages.  Now using the terminal input the command "node index.js", this will start the application.
